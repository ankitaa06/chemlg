# ChemLG
ChemLG is a smart and massive parallel molecular library generator for  chemical and materials sciences.


## Code Design:
ChemLG is developed in the Python 2 programming language and makes use of OpenBabel solftware for reading and writing molecules.


## Contributors:

- Mohammad Atif Faiz Afzal, CBE department, SUNY Buffalo
- Johannes Hachmann, CBE department, SUNY Buffalo

- We encourage any contributions and feedback. Feel free to fork and make pull-request to the "development" branch.


## Dependencies:
The only dependency of ChemLG is OpenBabel. MPI4Py library is required for parallel implementation of the code.
