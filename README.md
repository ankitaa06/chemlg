# ChemLG
ChemLG is a smart and massive parallel molecular library generator for chemical and materials sciences.


## Code Design:
ChemLG is developed in the Python 3 programming language and uses OpenBabel and its Python extension, Pybel for handling molecules. The development follows a strictly modular and object-oriented design to make the overall code as flexible and versatile as possible.

## Installation and Dependencies:
The dependencies for ChemLG are OpenBabel and MPI4Py. It is recommended that these two dependencies are installed in a virtual environment prior to installing ChemLG. They can be installed via the conda installer:


    conda create --name my_chemlg_env python=3.6
    source activate my_chemlg_env
    conda install -c openbabel openbabel
    conda install -c anaconda mpi4py
    
You can download ChemML from Python Package Index (PyPI) via pip. 

    pip install chemlg


You can test the installation with:

    pytest -v


Following additional (optional) packages are required (within the environment) to unlock some of the other functionalities of ChemLG:

ChemLG graphical config file builder:

    conda install â€“c conda-forge rdkit
    conda install ipykernel
    conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets
    python -m ipykernel install --name my_chemlg_env --display-name "chemlg"


ChemLG genetic algorithm module:

    pip install deap
