Building Blocks File
====================

By default, ChemLG looks for the building blocks in a file named: building_blocks.dat

The file should contain the molecules in SMILES or InChi format. Every molecule starts on a new line with no special characters at the beginning of the line.

   :alt: Linking two molecules


If connection is required at specific points only, add [X] to those points. If [X] is not provided, all [H] atoms will be considered for linking.

Config File
===========

The config file should closely follow the template provided in the library. The rules for library generation are to be specified as:

- Building Blocks: Specify the building blocks which must be present in all the molecules in the final library. 

        - Expected type: tuple of smiles of corresponding building blocks
        - Default value: None
|
- Number of Bonds: Enter the minimum and maximum values of the total number of bonds for all the molecules in the final library (integers). 

        - Expected type: tuple (min, max)
        - Default value: None
|
- Number of Atoms: Specify the minimum and maximum number of atoms that must be present in each molecule in the generation library (integers). 

        - Expected type: tuple (min, max)
        - Default value: None
|
- Molecular Weight Range: Specify the range of the molecular weight of the molecules in the generation library (integers). 

        - Expected type: tuple (min, max)
        - Default value: None
|
- Number of Rings: Specify the range of the number of rings present in the molecules in the generation library (integers). 

        - Expected type: tuple (min, max)
        - Default value: None
|
- Number of Aromatic Rings: Specify the range of the number of aromatic rings present in the molecules in the generation library (integers). 

        - Expected type: tuple (min, max)
        - Default value: None
|
- Number of Non-Aromatic Rings: Specify the range of the number of non aromatic rings present in the molecules in the generation library (integers). 

        - Expected type: tuple (min, max)
        - Default value: None
|
- Number of Single Bonds: Specify the range of the number of single bonds present in the molecules in the generation library (integers). 

        - Expected type: tuple (min, max)
        - Default value: None
|
- Number of Double Bonds: Specify the range of the number of double bonds present in the molecules in the generation library (integers). 

        - Expected type: tuple (min, max)
        - Default value: None
|
- Number of Triple Bonds: Specify the range of the number of triple bonds present in the molecules in the generation library (integers). 

        - Expected type: tuple (min, max)
        - Default value: None
|
- Heteroatoms: Specify the maximum number of (C, S, O, N) atoms that must be present in the molecules in the final library. 

        - Expected type: tuple of tuple(s) (('Cl', 10), )
        - Default value: None
|
- Lipinski Rule: Lipinski's rule of five is a rule of thumb to evaluate druglikeness or determine if a chemical compound with a certain pharmacological or biological activity has chemical properties and physical properties that would make it a likely orally active drug in humans. Select the choice to incorporate Lipinski rule for generating molecules in the final library. 

        - Expected type: string (True or False)
        - Default value: False
|
- Fingerprint Matching: Molecular fingerprints encode molecular structure in a series of binary digits that represent the presence or absence of particular substructures in the molecule. Comparing fingerprints will allow you to determine the similarity between two molecules. Type the target molecule and the Tanimoto index. 

        - Expected type: comma-separated target molecules c1ccccc1-0.1, C1CCCC1-0.1
        - Default value: None
|
- Substructure Inclusion: Enter substructures in SMARTS format which must be included in all molecules in the final library. 

        - Expected type: comma separated Smiles/SMARTS
        - Default value: None
|
- Substructure Exclusion: Enter substructures in SMARTS format which must be excluded in all molecules in the final library. 

        - Expected type: comma separated Smiles/SMARTS
        - Default value: None
|
- Include initial Building Blocks: Should the initial building blocks be included in the final library. 

        - Expected type: string (True or False)
        - Default value: None
