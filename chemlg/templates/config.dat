Generation rules:

        Building Blocks: Specify the building blocks which must be present in all the molecules in the final
        library. Expected type: tuple of building block codes

        Number of Bonds: Enter the minimum and maximum values of the total number of bonds for all the
        molecules in the final library (integers). Expected type: tuple (min, max)

        Number of Atoms: Specify the minimum and maximum number of atoms that must be present in
        each molecule in the generation library (integers). Expected type: tuple (min, max)

        Molecular Weight Range: Specify the range of the molecular weight of the molecules in the
        generation library (integers). Expected type: tuple (min, max)

        Number of Rings: Specify the range of the number of rings present in the molecules in the
        generation library (integers). Expected type: tuple (min, max)

        Number of Aromatic Rings: Specify the range of the number of aromatic rings present in the
        molecules in the generation library (integers). Expected type: tuple (min, max)

        Number of Non-Aromatic Rings: Specify the range of the number of non aromatic rings present
        in the molecules in the generation library (integers), Expected type: tuple (min, max)

        Number of Single Bonds: Specify the range of the number of single bonds present in the
        molecules in the generation library (integers). Expected type: tuple (min, max)

        Number of Double Bonds: Specify the range of the number of double bonds present in the molecules in the generation library
        (integers). Expected type: tuple (min, max)

        Number of Triple Bonds: Specify the range of the number of triple bonds present in the
        molecules in the generation library (integers). Expected type: tuple (min, max)

        Heteroatoms: Specify the maximum number of (C, S, O, N) atoms that must be present in the
        molecules in the final library. Expected type: tuple of tuple(s) (('Cl', 10), )

        Lipinski Rule: Lipinski's rule of five is a rule of thumb to evaluate druglikeness or determine if a
        chemical compound with a certain pharmacological or biological activity has chemical properties and
        physical properties that would make it a likely orally active drug in humans. Select the choice to
        incorporate Lipinski rule for generating molecules in the final library. Expected type: string (True or False)

        Fingerprint Matching: Molecular fingerprints encode molecular structure in a series of binary
        digits that represent the presence or absence of particular substructures in the molecule. Comparing
        fingerprints will allow you to determine the similarity between two molecules. Type the target molecule
        and the Tanimoto index. expected type: comma-separated target molecules c1ccccc1-0.1, C1CCCC1-0.1

        Substructure Inclusion: Enter substructures in SMARTS format which must be included in all
        molecules in the final library. expected type: comma separated Smiles/SMARTS

        Substructure Exclusion: Enter substructures in SMARTS format which must be excluded in all
        molecules in the final library. expected type: comma separated Smiles/SMARTS

        Include initial Building Blocks: Should the initial building blocks be included in the final library. Expected type: string (True or False)

        17. Combination order (currently not functional) - None
        18. Symmetry (currently not functional) - None



Building blocks: 
    Smiles or InChi of building blocks: If connection is required at specific points, add [Ra] atom to those specific points. 
                                            If [Ra] atoms are not provided, all [H] atoms will be considered for reaction.
